            Welcome to BruinMatch! We took inspiration from Harvard's DataMatch, and
            noticed that UCLA doesn't have any sort of equivalent.
            <br />
            <br />
            This quiz is 20 questions, and at 12:00am on February 14th you will
            receive an email with your partner with highest compatibility score!
            This score is calculated using AI based on your answers. All questions are free response to give you freedom to express yourself however you wish. I swear it's not because of bad design and tight deadlines :)
            <br />
            <br />
            Our AI is programmed to analyze not only your answers but your tone and text patterns in order to do its best to match you with someone who fits your vibe!
            <br />
            <br />
            Note that you <strong>MUST</strong> use your UCLA email or else we will filter out your response. We will also be using AI to filter out duplicate/invalid responses.
